## Rules
**Goal:** The first player to reach 100 points win the game ! :checkered_flag:

Player 1 starts the game and has 2 options: 

1. Roll dice 
2. Hold

If the player decides to roll the dice, his current score will increment 
   by the dice value as long as the dice is not a 1.

If the player rolls a 1, it's the next player turn, and you loose all your 'current points'.

If the player click the hold button, he keeps his current accumulated score into his permanent score. The game then switch players.


Have fun :smile:
